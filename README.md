# AbPoker

A Poker hand rank evaluator, written in TypeScript as an Angular application.

## Getting started

To get the app up and running:

Run `npm install` then `npm start`

Once the [Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) has finished bundling, the app will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the app's unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

This project has also been configured to run unit tests via [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com/), if you're into that kind of thing (it's pretty great).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the (pretty small number of) end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.
